May your troubles be as few as your selfies and your blessings be as abundant as your WiFi signal.
To love, laughter, and a happily ever after!
Here's to the nights we won't remember and the friends we'll never forget.
May your pockets be heavy and your heart be light. May good luck pursue you each morning and night.
Cheers to the friends who know us best and love us anyway.
May your coffee be strong, and your Monday be short.
To health, wealth, and a great deal of stealth when your boss is around!
May the only pain you feel be champagne.
Here's to staying positive and testing negative!
May your troubles be less and your blessings be more, and nothing but happiness come through your door.
